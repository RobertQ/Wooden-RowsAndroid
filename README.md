# Wooden Rows
Wooden Rows is an EnyoJS (v1) app that allows users to keep track of their physical movies, video games, books, and music in a virtual shelf system. Items can be searched by barcode, ISBN, or keyword. Once added to the app, all items are synced to the Wooden Rows server (http://woodenro.ws) so that items can be synced on all devices.

## Platforms
As the app is an EnyoJS app, it can, when combined with PhoneGap, be deployed to not only webOS, but also Android and iOS. Using MacGap, it can be deployed to OS X. The app could even be run from a webserver in any WebKit browser.

## The Project
The Open Source aspect of Wooden Rows allows for users to customize and contribute to the Wooden Rows client (app). Server-side aspects will be continually maintained exclusively by Zhephree, LLC. The closed API is made available to contributers to the open source aspect of the project. If new features require new API end points, Zhephree can accomodate these requests. The official Wooden Rows clients will be made available for purchase in the respective app stores. The sales of the clients go directly to funding server hosting and bandwidth costs.
